repoze.configuration Changelog
==============================

Next release
------------

- It was not possible to resolve the single dot ``.`` using
  repoze.configuration.context.Context.resolve to the current package.

- Using a Python %(interpolation)s marker in any string value allows
  you to resolve expand names from the registry.

- Use pyyaml's SafeLoader rather than Loader: we don't really need to
  be able to construct arbitrary Python objects.

0.2 (2009-07-13)
----------------

- Trying to read any directive section that wasn't a YAML mapping
  caused a TypeError (e.g. ``construct_scalar takes no argument
  'deep'``).

0.1 (2009-06-22)
----------------

- Initial release.
